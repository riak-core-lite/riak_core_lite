%% @doc This is a wrapper around a poolboy pool, that implements a
%% queue. That is, this process maintains a queue of work, and checks
%% workers out of a poolboy pool to consume it.
%%
%% The workers it uses send two messages to this process.
%%
%% The first message is at startup, the bare atom
%% `worker_started'. This is a clue to this process that a worker was
%% just added to the poolboy pool, so a checkout request has a chance
%% of succeeding. This is most useful after an old worker has exited -
%% `worker_started' is a trigger guaranteed to arrive at a time that
%% will mean an immediate poolboy:checkout will not beat the worker
%% into the pool.
%%
%% The second message is when the worker finishes work it has been
%% handed, the two-tuple, `{checkin, WorkerPid}'. This message gives
%% this process the choice of whether to give the worker more work or
%% check it back into poolboy's pool at this point. Note: the worker
%% should *never* call poolboy:checkin itself, because that will
%% confuse (or cause a race) with this module's checkout management.
